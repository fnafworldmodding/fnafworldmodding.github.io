::: danger

Using Scarlet is a risky idea.
1. Scarlet uses private certs, which could blacklist your Device from using actual certs in the future. 
2. Scarlet revokes often, which means you will have to restart this guide every time it revokes.

**Continue following this guide if you understand the risks.**

::: tip

If you are using an iOS 16+ Device, you will need to take extra steps beforehand to open sideloaded apps:

1. Open Settings
1. Go to Privacy & Security and find the `Developer Mode` entry
1. Toggle Developer Mode on, then press `Reboot`
1. After the device reboots, unlock it, and confirm that you want to enable Developer Mode
  - If you have a passcode enabled, you'll need to enter it.
