## General Questions

### How can i sideload without a Computer?

Scarlet, TrollStore (installation with TrollInstallerX + jailbreaks.app) and using a paid Certificate, are the only ways how, and Scarlet gets revoked REALLY often.

Certificates are the easiest option if your iOS version does not support TrollStore. If you cannot afford them, Scarlet is your only option.

### Why isn't AltStore/SideStore here?

Sideloadly is arguably better, and i have decided not to include AltStore/SideStore as it is a more tedious process, and Sideloadly allows you to install one more app then with AltStore.
