## General Questions

### How can i sideload without a Computer?

Scarlet and TrollStore (installation with TrollInstallerX + jailbreaks.app) are the only ways how, and Scarlet gets revoked REALLY often. Scarlet is not recommended either, but most times it is your only choice.

### Why isn't AltStore/SideStore here?

Sideloadly is arguably better, and i have decided not to include AltStore/SideStore as it is a more tedious process, and Sideloadly allows you to install one more app then with AltStore.
