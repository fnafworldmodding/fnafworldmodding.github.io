## What is Sideloading?

Sideloading is a term used to describe the process that allows you to install any iOS app, not on the App Store. In this case it will be used to install FNaF World.


## What should I know before starting?


- It is WAY easier to sideload while having a computer, but if you don't, it is most definitely still possible.
- Most tools only allow you to have 3 apps sideloaded, for example Sideloadly and AltStore. TrollStore and AppSync bypass this limitation.
