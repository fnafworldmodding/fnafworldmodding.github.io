Thoroughly read all of the introductory pages (including this one!) before proceeding.


## What is Sideloading?

Sideloading is a term used to describe the process that allows you to install any iOS app, not on the app store. In this case it will be used to install FNaF World.


## What should I know before starting?


- It is WAY easier to sideload while having a computer, but if you don't, it is still possible.
- Follow the guide carefully.
