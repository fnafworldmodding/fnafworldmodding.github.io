## Required Reading

Semi-untethered jailbreaks require the use of a sideloaded app to jailbreak. Apps sideloaded with a regular Apple ID will expire after 7 days (or 365 days with a Developer Apple ID). After that period, you will no longer be able to open that app to re-jailbreak.

::: danger

If you are using an iOS 16 beta, you will need to take extra steps beforehand to open sideloaded apps:

1. Open Settings
1. Go to Privacy & Security and find the `Developer Mode` entry
1. Toggle Developer Mode on, then press `Reboot`
1. After the device reboots, unlock it, and confirm that you want to enable Developer Mode
  - If you have a passcode enabled, you'll need to enter it.

## Sideload using Sideloadly

::: tip

Sideloadly is compatible with iOS 7 and newer.

:::

1. Open Sideloadly
1. Plug your iOS device into your computer
    - Make sure your computer is trusted and allowed to view the contents of your device
1. Drag and drop the `.ipa` file of your choice into Sideloadly
1. Enter in your Apple ID
1. Enter in your password
    - Sideloadly must make a request to it's servers in order to work with free developer accounts. If you are not OK with this, you may use an alternate Apple ID.
