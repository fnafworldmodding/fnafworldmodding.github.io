Unless [jailbreaks.app](https://jailbreaks.app) is signed, you will NEED a computer to jailbreak, and therefore to follow this tutorial.

:::

## Jailbreaking

On iOS versions 12.0 to 14.0b1, AppSync is one of the easiest ways to sideload, except it needs a jailbreak. Follow [ios.cfw.guide](https://ios.cfw.guide) to successfully jailbreak.


## Installing AppSync

1. After you are jailbroken, Click on [this link](https://cydia.akemi.ai/add.php) to add the repo to your Package Manager.
2. Open your package manager. (Sileo, Zebra, Cydia)
3. Refresh your packages, update all if prompted.
4. Add "[this](http://tigisoftware.com/repo/)" to your repo list.
4. Install "AppSync Unified" and "Filza" from the list of packages. If you cannot find it, use the search bar.

## Using AppSync

1. Download the IPA you want to install. (in this case FNaF World Mobile)
2. Open Filza, and find the directory at which you had downloaded it at.
3. Hold the IPA file, and click install.
4. If the app does not open, or does not install properly, you do not have enough storage, or you do not have AppSync Unified installed.
